Welcome to the IFR Dockerised version of the Welsh Genepark's 
Introduction to Command-line NGS Analysis course!
The original materials belong to Wesh Genepark and the original
materials and software can be found at
http://www.walesgenepark.cardiff.ac.uk/bioinformatics/training/

This was originally designed to be deployed onto Raspberry pi
computers.  Our version will run on any linux machine running Docker 
Host (or on Windows PC & Macs running Docker Toolbox (Kitematic)).

There are updated links to data files and we have provided an i86 
version of the GATK (rather than the original ARM version).
